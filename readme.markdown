MamIRC, the headless IRC client
===============================

MamIRC is an IRC client designed for users who value portable web access, high uptime, and accurate logging.

It comes in two parts - a Java backend and a web page frontend. The backend is intended to run on an always-on server computer, and the frontend can be accessed by a desktop or mobile web browser.

For setup instructions, see [setup.markdown](https://github.com/nayuki/MamIRC/blob/master/doc/setup.markdown).

Architecture of the software and data flow:
